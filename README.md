Algorithms and Data Structures

Overview

For this module's assignment I was tasked with designing and implementing a number of algorithms and data structures to 
solve the problems outlined in the assessment brief. This was to be done using the knowledge taught in the lectures as 
well as tutorials. 

Projects:

1. Algorithmic Complexity
2. Dinner Plate Organisation Simulator
3. Graphs with Singly Linked Lists
4. Weights and Load Problem
5. Weights and Load Implementation

All the above-mentioned projects have been implemented here is this project.
